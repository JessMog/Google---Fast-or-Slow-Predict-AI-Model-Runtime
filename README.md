# Google-Fast-or-Slow?Predict-AI-Model-Runtime
Predict how fast an AI model runs
## Overview
Alice is an AI model developer, but some of the models her team developed run very slow. She recently discovered compiler's configurations that change the way the compiler compiles and optimizes the models, and hence make the models run faster (or slower)! My task is to help Alice find the best configuration for each model.

**My goal**: Train a machine learning model based on the runtime data provided in the training dataset and further predict the runtime of graphs and configurations in the test dataset.
